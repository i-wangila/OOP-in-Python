How to Create OOP Classes in Python
📌 Overview

This project is a simple guide to understanding Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python. It shows how to:

Create classes and objects

Use constructors to initialize data

Apply inheritance and encapsulation

Demonstrate polymorphism with different behaviors

🚀 Examples

Laptop Class – shows attributes (brand, model, battery) and methods to run programs and recharge.

Inheritance & Encapsulation – Laptop inherits from Gadget and uses a private battery attribute.

Polymorphism – Animal subclasses (Cat, Horse, Snake) each define their own move() action.

🖥️ Sample Output
💻 Running Python on Dell XPS 15...
🔋 Spectre x360 battery recharged to 85%
⚡ Apple gadget is powering up.
🖥️ Apple MacBook Pro is opening Xcode...
🔌 Charging MacBook Pro... Battery at 85%
Apple gadget is shutting down.
🐈 Cat is gracefully walking on the roof.
🐎 Horse is galloping across the field.
🐍 Snake is slithering silently through the grass.
